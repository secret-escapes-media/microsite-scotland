    - title: Munro Bagging
      id: munro-bagging
      content: In case you didn’t know, a “munro” is a Scottish mountain with a height of over 3,000 feet - if you manage to reach the summit, you might say you’ve “bagged it”, and for good reason, too. From the formidable boulder fields of Schiehallion to the sweeping landscapes and high altitudes of Ben Chonzie and Mount Keen, the 282 munros of Scotland are as physically challenging as they are beautiful.

    - title: White Water Rafting
      id: white-water-rafting
      content: Hidden away in the historic county of Perthshire, the rollercoaster rapids along the River Tay remain a hot location for the wild at heart. Being the largest river in Scotland to offer white water rafting, the River Tay boasts a wide range of rapids for beginners and adrenaline junkies alike. Ride downstream for an adrenaline-fuelled 6 hours, through stunning wildlife and heavy waters, paddle in hand, helmet on head, and heartbeat racing.

    - title: Canyoning
      id: canyoning
      content: Though immortalised in a poem by Robert Burns, the Falls of Bruar is almost as famous for its canyoning. This deep-green wonderland is awash with slide chutes, outcrops, 40-ft jumps and natural rock arches to negotiate on your way down through the gorge. Making use of a variety of outdoor skills - such as climbing, wild swimming and abseiling - you’ll gain first-hand experience of the untamed Scottish wilderness.

    - title: Land Yachting
      id: land-yachting
      content: An unlikely fusion of go-karting and sailing, ‘land yachting’ is a popular fixture of St Andrews’ West Sands in The Kingdom of Fife. With the sea-breeze as your motor, speed along this lengthy stretch of beach; race against your friends or just take it for a spin and discover the beauty of the coast. Other activities here include surfing, kayaking and ‘zapcatting’ - a means of shooting across the water on high-speed catamarans.

    - title: Scuba Diving
      id: scuba-diving
      content: In the depths of the Argyll coastline lies a treasure-trove of aquatic wonders. Between the vibrant coral reefs along the Firth of Lorn conservation site, the Corryvreckan whirlpool, the ethereal glow of the kelp forests, and the S.S Breda shipwreck - this is a site of deep-sea majesty. For marine life, too, the Spring and Summer months bring a fascinating host of Neptunian creatures, including minke whales, grey seals and basking sharks.

    - title: Caving
      id: caving
      content: "Visit the uninhabited island of Staffa in the Inner Hebrides for Fingal’s Cave, a true masterpiece of the ancient world. Formed of hexagonally-jointed basalt columns (the result of a centuries-old lava flow) it’s often called ‘the melodious cave’, due to the deep echoes of swirling ocean inside - a known source of inspiration for artists and poets. Indeed, for the ghostly sense of the occult alone, a trip to Fingal’s Cave is truly one for the bucket list: an existential adventure through time forgotten. "

    - title: Paragliding
      id: paragliding
      content: Take to the skies for a dramatic, panoramic view of the Isle of Arran, known as Scotland in miniature. A short hillside run will see you lifted up in your very own paraglider. Whether you conquer the sport for yourself on a crash course, book an introductory session, or take a one-off tandem flight with an instructor, there’s no better way of seeing the black lochs, wild moors, and heart-skipping hillsides for all their green and golden brown splendour.

    - title: Horseback riding
      id: horseback-riding
      content: "Experience the rolling hills, ancient trails and vast forests of the Cairngorms National Park the old fashioned way: on horseback. With a variety of stables across the Highlands, including the excellent Newtonmore Riding Centre, riders can choose between relaxing treks, challenging hacks and professional 1-to-1 lessons. Against a luscious backdrop of sweeping mountainscapes, the terrain here is as varied as it is rich - a true rider’s paradise. "
