    - title: Dumfries & Galloway
      id: dumfries-galloway
      content: This region offers the perfect blend of coastal and forest scenery. The Solway Coast is a beachcomber’s haven with an array of shell beaches, and for avid star gazers, there is The Galloway Forest Park. Due to its sparse population and lack of light pollution, it was named the country’s first Dark Sky Park. If you’re feeling sporty, rent a mountain bike at the 7stanes centre for sweat-inducing inclines and soul-stirring views.

    - title: Angus
      id: angus
      content: Escape to the east of Scotland for the undisturbed valleys of the Angus Glens. Against the backdrop of the Grampian Mountains, dust off your walking boots and stroll deep into the peaceful Scottish countryside. During your visit, be sure to take a trip to the wind-swept Angus coast, where you’ll find the rolling dunes and strawberry blonde sands of Lunan Bay. A secluded beach that stretches from Boddin Point to Land Craig, it’s the perfect way to wind down on an easy-going, sunny afternoon.

    - title: The Scottish Borders
      id: the-scottish-borders
      content: Step inside the picturesque, medieval villages of the Scottish Borders. From the historicism of Melrose to the awe-inspiring vistas of Scott’s View, there’s a quiet charm to this landscape that’s utterly infectious. While you’re here, too, why not stop over at Stobo Castle? This A-listed building now operates as a luxury spa retreat, complete with a state-of-the-art Ozone pool, Hydrospa and mud room - you may never feel stressed again.

    - title: The Outer Hebrides
      id: the-outer-hebrides
      content: A collection of islands at the edge of the Atlantic, the Outer Hebrides offer a true escape from the rat race. Here you’ll find a slower pace of life exploring rugged coast and countryside, observing stunning wildlife and fauna, and visiting prehistoric gems such as the Calanais Standing Stones on the Isle of Lewis. In the towns, however, you’ll hear Gaelic being spoken by the locals, traditional folk music been played in the pubs, and will no doubt get a taste for smoked fish - a Hebrides delicacy.


    - title: National Parks
      id: national-parks
      content: Snow-capped mountains, teeming wildlife, long walks in the woods - the national parks of Scotland are among the finest in the Europe. The Cairngorms National Park in the north-east is twice the size of the Lake District, boasting sprawling forests, glassy lakes and misty peaks - it brims with the wild romance of the natural world. The snowscapes atop the Cairngorms mountains have also made it a popular skiing destination; the season generally running until early April. To the south of Scotland, meanwhile, the Loch Lomond & Trossachs National Park features the large stretch of inland water in the UK. Rent a kayak or take a leisurely cruise across the shimmering loch, before losing yourself in the whistling wilds of the Trossachs.

    - title: Aberdeenshire
      id: aberdeenshire
      content: As well as boasting the world’s finest fish and chips, the region of Aberdeenshire to the north-east of Scotland is famed for its dramatic coastlines, rugged cliffs and delightful seaside towns. Head to the town of Stonehaven for some unbeatable seafood along the harbour, before heading south to the RSPB Fowlsheugh Reserve, where heart-stopping cliffs are populated by dolphins, seals, puffins and, in the warmer months, around 130,000 mating seabirds. The fishing opportunities, too, are second to none, so make sure to visit the River Dee for a relaxing spot of salmon fishing.

    - title: Shetland
      id: shetland
      content: "Composed of more than 100 islands (15 of which are inhabited), Scotland’s most northerly archipelago is a haven of seclusion, a fairytale landscape of undiluted beauty. Between the white sands and shimmering blue coastlines, the heather-strewn moors, the tree-less hills and windswept clifftops, the Shetland islands offer a welcome retreat from the pressures of city-life. It’s also an animal-lover’s paradise: with puffins, seals, minke whales, and even orcas among the creatures to be seen - a sequestered escape you’re unlikely to forget."

    - title: The Kingdom of Fife
      id: the-kingdom-of-fife
      content: "Overlooking miles of sea and countryside, Oban is a charming, coast-side gem, with an array of beaches, forests, historic attractions, and foodie delights. Known as ‘little bay’ in Gaelic, Oban is the seafood capital of Scotland, with an abundance of award-winning restaurants and eateries overlooking the coast - if you’re lucky, you might even catch a West Coast sunset, famous for their blood red hues. The port is also a gateway for exploring the surrounding islands by boat. With good food, good views, and adventure at your doorstep: what more could you ask for?"
