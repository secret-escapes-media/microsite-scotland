The Cairngorms National Park in the northeast is twice the size of the Lake District and boasts sprawling forests, glassy lakes and misty peaks - it brims with the wild romance of the natural world. The altitudes of the Cairngorm mountains have also made it a popular skiing destination; the season generally running until early April. To the southwest, meanwhile, Loch Lomond & The Trossachs National Park features the largest stretch of inland water in the UK. Rent a kayak or take a leisurely cruise across the shimmering loch, before losing yourself in the whistling wilds of The Trossachs.

      location: Shetland Islands, Scotland
      content: "Composed of more than 100 islands (15 of which are inhabited), Scotland’s most northerly archipelago is a haven of seclusion, a fairytale landscape of undiluted beauty. Between the white sands and shimmering blue coastlines, the heather-strewn moors, the treeless hills and the windswept clifftops, the Shetland Isles offer a welcome retreat from the pressures of city life. It’s also an animal-lover’s paradise with puffins, seals, orcas, and of course the famous Shetland ponies among the creatures to be seen - a sequestered escape you’re unlikely to forget."
