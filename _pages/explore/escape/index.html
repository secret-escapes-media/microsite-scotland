  <p class="text--lg">Switch off your phone, and breathe at last - the rolling hills and open skies of Scotland make it ideal for a digital detox. Take a trip to the coastal villages along the West Coast, famed for their beauty, their seafood, and their down-to-earth people; or retreat inland, and unpick the rivers, lochs and blooming flora of the upcountry. The sense of balance and reflection so typical to these areas becomes infectious to those who visit - the perfect escape for the weary mind. </p>

  highlights:

    - title: Dumfries & Galloway
      id: dumfries-galloway
      content: Sometimes referred to as ’Scotland in miniature’, Dumfries and Galloway is home to breathtaking nature parks, award-winning biking trails, and a host of lovely bucolic villages. Due to its sparse population and lack of light pollution, Galloway Forest was named the country’s first Dark Sky Park - a sprawling mattress of trees beneath a heavy blanket of stars… If you’re feeling sporty, meanwhile, rent a mountain bike at the 7stanes centre for sweat-inducing inclines and soul-stirring views.

    - title: Lunan Bay
      id: lunan-bay
      content: On the wind-swept Angus coast you’ll find the rolling dunes and strawberry blonde sands of Lunan Bay, a secluded beach, stretching between Boddin Point and Land Craig, that’s just perfect for a sunny day. Overlooked by the ruins of the historic Red Castle, a structure first built to defend against Viking invaders, the bay has since become a popular swimming, surfing, horse-riding and sunbathing destination - not to mention a hot spot for bird-watchers.

    - title: The Scottish Borders
      id: the-scottish-borders
      content: Step inside the picturesque, medieval villages of the Scottish Borders. From the historicism of Melrose to the easy-going fishing town of Eyemouth, there’s a quiet charm to this landscape that’s utterly infectious. While you’re here, too, why not stop over at Stobo Castle? This A-listed building now operates as a luxury spa retreat, complete with a state-of-the-art Ozone pool, Hydrospa and mud room - you may never feel stressed again.

    - title: The Outer Hebrides
      id: the-outer-hebrides
      content: A collection of islands cast adrift on the Westerly shores of the Atlantic, the Outer Hebrides offers a true escape from the rat-race. Here you’ll find a slower pace of life, as you explore the untrammelled coasts and countrysides, see stunning wildlife and fauna, or visit pre-historic gems, such as the Calanais Standing Stones on the Isle of Lewis. In the towns, however, you’ll hear Gaelic being spoken by the locals, traditional folk music been played in the pubs, and will no doubt get a taste for smoked fish - a Hebrides delicacy.

    - title: Whisky on the West Coast
      id: whisky-on-the-west-coast
      content: "Sail to the islands of Islay, Arran, Jura, Iona, and others along the West Coast, in search of one of Scotland’s best loved exports: malt whisky. Each of the islands you’ll visit on your journey feature an array of distilleries in which to discover the secrets of whisky-making; as well to drink it, of course. It’s also a good way of getting a feel for the islands themselves, for visiting the local towns and villages, and for sampling the local restaurants and markets."

    - title: Stonehaven
      id: stonehaven
      content: "Voted Britain’s top foodie destination last year, this harbour town to the south of Aberdeen proudly boasts the world’s finest fish and chips, although it’s probably better known as the birthplace of the deep-fried Mars bar. Take a walk along the harbour for top-class restaurants, ice cream parlours and bustling drinking holes. And if it’s the fresh air you’re after, head south for the RSPB Fowlsheugh Reserve, where the heart-stopping cliffs are populated by dolphins, seals, puffins and, in the warmer months, around 130,000 mating seabirds."

    - title: Dunkeld & Birnam
      id: dunkeld-birnam
      content: "Deep in the heart of Perthshire’s ‘Big Tree Country’, the adjacent towns of Dunkeld and Birnam sit on either side of the winding River Tay. A distinctly Victorian feel pervades through the grey stone architecture of these towns - it can almost feel like stepping into another world. Equally, in serving as inspiration for both Beatrix Potter and Shakespeare’s Macbeth, the surrounding forestland, with its ancient oaks and blooming flora, inspires a sense of calm and reflection; ideal for a Springtime getaway."

    - title: Oban
      id: oban
      content: "Overlooking miles of sea and countryside, Oban is a charming, coast-side gem, with an array of beaches, forests, historic attractions, and foodie delights. Known as ‘little bay’ in Gaelic, Oban is the seafood capital of Scotland, with an abundance of award-winning restaurants and eateries overlooking the coast - if you’re lucky, you might even catch a West Coast sunset, famous for their blood red hues. The port is also a gateway for exploring the surrounding islands by boat. With good food, good views, and adventure at your doorstep: what more could you ask for?"
