  <p class="text--xl">The unique culture of Scotland is so much more than kilts and bagpipes (although there are plenty of those around). From Neolithic villages to world-class art galleries, and from medieval castles to traditional boat festivals, there’s a certain magic to the country’s blending of the old and new - dive in, and see for yourself. </p>

    highlights:

      - title: V&A Dundee
        id: v-a-dundee
        content: On the edge of the River Tay, the recently opened V&A in Dundee is a feat of modern architecture, with curving concrete walls reminiscent of a Scottish cliff face. Centred entirely around the art of design, the exhibitions here aim to celebrate the country’s rich heritage of innovation, while also championing the contemporary talents of the future. Once you’ve finished perusing the galleries, make sure to check out the outdoor terrace for spectacular views across the Tay.

      - title: Skara Brae
        id: skara-brae
        content: Often regarded as one of the most spectacular prehistoric sites in Western Europe, the Neolithic village of Skara Brae provides a vivid picture of life lived around 5,000 years ago. Found on the coast of Mainland, the largest island of the Orkney archipelago, these ancient homes are fitted with beds of stone, and even dressers, while an array of tools and artefacts can be seen at the nearby Visitor’s Centre - a fascinating, and deeply moving testament to human kind.

      - title: Knockengorroch World Ceilidh Festival
        id: knockengorroch-world-ceilidh-festival
        content: Billed as a “hoedown in the hills”, this lesser-known music festival takes  place in Galloway between the 23rd and 26th of March. An eclectic mix of Celtic, world and roots music, expect a riotous three days of singing, dancing, drinking and storytelling. Being a family festival at heart, there’s also a children’s marquee and procession, as well as puppet shows, fire shows, and array of delicious world cuisine.

      - title: Riverside Museum
        id: riverside-museum
        content: Featuring an award-winning collection of transport-related objects from Glasgow’s past, the Riverside Museum takes visitors on a journey (no pun intended) through the city’s industrial heritage. You’ll find everything from skateboards and bicycles to vintage cars and steam-powered locomotives. Many of the displays are interactive - there’s even a recreation of an old Glasgow street, complete with vehicles and shopfronts from the late 19th century.

      - title: Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum
        id: kelvingrove-art-gallery-and-museum
        content: "With 22 galleries and a jaw-dropping 8,000 artefacts of world history, it’s no wonder Kelvingrove remains one of Glasgow’s most-visited attractions. The artworks on offer here span a wide range of periods, fields and movements - everything from Rembrandt to the French Impressionists - while the museum section covers an extensive collection of natural and human history. After your visit, make sure to take a walk through the park, if only to appreciate the Spanish Baroque style of the building a little better."

      - title: Scottish Traditional Boat Festival
        id: scottish-traditional-boat-festival
        content: "This gathering of traditional boats in the seaside town of Portsoy in Aberdeenshire, is, more than anything, a celebration of the Scottish spirit. Watch the crews battle it out in competitive races across the coast, the parades on the streets, the local craftsmen selling their wares, or the musicians on the stage. While you’re here, don’t miss your chance to taste the world-famous delicacies of the region: Aberdeen Angus beef, traditional shortbread, ice cold craft beer…"

      - title: Stirling Castle
        id: stirling-castle
        content: A castle of unique historical importance to Scotland, and a marvel of medieval architecture that’s surrounded by steep cliffs. Once a majestic royal residence, inhabited by Mary Queen of Scotts among others, the castle is now a popular attraction, with costumed characters and guided tours. Make sure, in particular, to take a wander through the Presence Chamber, where portraits of past monarchs adorn the high ceilings.

      - title: Dundee Contemporary Arts
        id: dundee-contemporary-arts
        content: A beacon of creativity in the heart of the city, Dundee Contemporary Arts is an exciting cultural space dedicated to the new and experimental. Featuring two large gallery spaces, a cinema with a penchant for the avant-garde, a café-bar, and a busy calendar of events and workshops, it’s one of the most vibrant and successful arts organisations in the UK.
