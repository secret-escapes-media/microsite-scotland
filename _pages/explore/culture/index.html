    highlights:

      - title: V&A Dundee
        id: v-a-dundee
        content: On the edge of the River Tay, the recently opened V&A in Dundee is a feat of modern architecture, with curving concrete walls reminiscent of a Scottish cliff face. Centred entirely around the art of design, the exhibitions here aim to celebrate the country’s rich heritage of innovation, while also championing the contemporary talents of the future. Once you’ve finished perusing the galleries, make sure to check out the outdoor terrace for spectacular views across the Tay.

      - title: Skara Brae
        id: skara-brae
        content: Often regarded as one of the most spectacular prehistoric sites in Western Europe, the Neolithic village of Skara Brae provides a vivid picture of life lived around 5,000 years ago. Found on the Mainland, the largest island of the Orkney archipelago, these ancient homes are fitted with beds of stone, and even dressers, while an array of tools and artefacts can be seen at the nearby Visitor’s Centre - a fascinating, and deeply moving testament to human achievement.

      - title: Knockengorroch World Ceilidh Festival
        id: knockengorroch-world-ceilidh-festival
        content: Billed as a “hoedown in the hills”, this lesser-known music festival takes place in Dumfries & Galloway between the 23rd and 26th of March. With an eclectic mix of Celtic, world and roots music, expect a riotous three days of singing, dancing, drinking and storytelling. Being a family festival at heart, there’s also a children’s marquee and procession, as well as puppet shows, fire shows, and an array of delicious world cuisine.

      - title: Abbotsford House
        id: abbotsford-house
        content: The ancestral home of the world-renowned poet and novelist, Sir Walter Scott, offers a beguiling insight into the mind of the man himself. Located on the stunning banks of the River Tweed in the Scottish Borders, Abbotsford House tells the tale of Scott’s tumultuous life, while offering visitors a glimpse into the tastes and preoccupations of the Romantic movement of which he was a part. For the full literary experience, however, there’s also the option of staying the night in the Hope Scott Wing - a chance to experience some 19th century hospitality, as one of Walter Scott’s distinguished guests.

      - title: Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum
        id: kelvingrove-art-gallery-and-museum
        content: "With 22 galleries and a jaw-dropping 8,000 artefacts of world history, it’s no wonder Kelvingrove remains one of Glasgow’s most-visited attractions. The artworks on offer here span a wide range of periods, fields and movements - everything from Rembrandt to the French Impressionists - while the museum section covers an extensive collection of natural and human history. After your visit, make sure to take a walk through the park, if only to appreciate the Spanish Baroque style of the building a little better. "

      - title: Fèis Ìle, The Islay Festival of Music and Malt
        id: feis-ile-the-islay-festival-of-music-and-malt
        content: "Sail to the Isle of Islay, a beautiful island off the west coast of Scotland, in search of one of country’s best loved exports: malt whisky. Held on the last week of May each year, Fèis Ìle is a celebration of the island’s many distilleries, and a chance to sample some of the best whiskies known to man. There’s more to the festival than just boozing, however: expect to encounter some traditional Gaelic music, some hearty Scottish cooking, and (of course) some good local craic."

      - title: Stirling Castle
        id: stirling-castle
        content: Perched on top of a volcanic outcrop, this castle has unique historical importance to Scotland and is a marvel of medieval architecture. Once a majestic royal residence, inhabited by Mary Queen of Scots among others, the castle is now a popular attraction with costumed characters and guided tours. Make sure to take a wander through the Presence Chamber, where portraits of past monarchs adorn the high ceilings.

      - title: Pitlochry Festival Theatre
        id: pitlochry-festival-theatre
        content: A beacon of storytelling in the hills of Perthshire, the charming town of Pitlochry offers a theatre experience like no other. Situated on the banks of the Tummel river, and with jaw-dropping views of Ben Vrackie, the Festival Theatre holds a varied program of acclaimed performances - everything from Shakespeare to Tom Stoppard. Whilst you’re in the area, too, make sure to check out the Pitlochry Dam Visitor Centre, a museum showcasing the rich history of hydro electricity in the north of Scotland.
